### HTTP Request
- **Request Line** (method, path, version)
- **Headers** (key-value pairs)
- **Optional Body** (for POST, PUT requests)

Example:
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
```

### HTTP Response
- **Status Line** (version, status code, message)
- **Headers** (key-value pairs)
- **Body** (content like HTML, JSON, etc.)

Example:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234
